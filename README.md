# ImageViewScroll
ImageView that can be scrolled and zoomed in/out.

<p>When we use the ImageViewScroll in xml we have to define our xmlns, with the package where the ImageViewScroll class is located:</p>
<code>xmlns:custom="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/com.blogspot.techzealous.imageviewscroll"</code><br><br>

<p>We have two properties that we can use in xml:</p>
<code>image_name</code><br>
<code>fit_on_screen</code> - (not currently implemented, so it will do nothing)<br>
<br><br>
You can find them in the value/attr.xml file.
<br>

You can scroll the image by draging and zoom in and out by pinch/squeeze.<br/><br/>
